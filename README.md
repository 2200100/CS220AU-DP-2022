# CS220AU Digital Portfolio Template (2022)
## Overview
This GitHub repository is the template for the [CS220AU](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU) assignment in 2022. It demonstrates minimalistic ideas for 

- project management
- web hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
- web-design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
- evaluation with the `assessment.md` and the `dp-checklist.md` files. 

During the term, we were taught how to create a GitHub repository. This website mainly focuses on biotechnology. Its approach is how it can be considered an existential risk to digital identities, but it also provides concept definitions and examples to make everything easier to understand. It is divided into four sections: biotechnology and its applications; advantages and disadvantages; existential risks and digital identities; and how does biotechnology threaten my digital identity?

The URL of the website can be found in the sidebar, under 'About'. The homepage uses the information in the `index.md` file.
