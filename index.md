EXISTENTIAL RISK: BIOTHECNOLOGY


What is an existential risk? “By “existential risks” (E.R.) we mean, roughly, catastrophic risks to our species that are “our fault,” in the sense that they arise from human technologies” mentions Huw Price in an article by The New York Times. Biotechnology could be hard to link as an existential risk, but when you analyze it in depth, you realize that biotechnology includes many things, many as technology itself.

Have you ever thought about the fact that your fingerprints are wandering around the whole world, and you don’t even notice? Or that anything could be easily cloned with the smallest gene? Biotechnology has been an issue for the last few years, and even though it is a great step for humanity, it also has its risks; but what are those risks? From the development of vaccines, to processes to recover ecosystems damaged by human activity, the uses and applications of biotechnology cover a wide spectrum of possibilities, as much as threats. 


Pros:
Golden biotechnology

Also referred to as bioinformatics, it involves the application of computational biology. Its objective is to address biological problems through computational techniques, allowing the organization, analysis, and interpretation of large volumes of information and biological data.


Cons:
Dark biotechnology

Black or dark biotechnology is that associated with illegal and harmful practices for both humanity and the planet, such as bioterrorism or the production of biological weapons through the manipulation of microorganisms and toxins that cause disease, poisoning and death.
