# **BIOTECHNOLOGY AS AN EXISTENTIAL RISK TO DIGITAL IDENTITIES**


What is an existential risk? “By “existential risks” (E.R.) we mean, roughly, catastrophic risks to our species that are “our fault,” in the sense that they arise from human technologies” mentions Huw Price in an article by The New York Times. Biotechnology could be hard to link as an existential risk, but when you analyze it in depth, you realize that biotechnology includes many things, many as technology itself.

Have you ever thought about the fact that your fingerprints are wandering around the whole world, and you don’t even notice? Or that anything could be easily cloned with the smallest gene? Biotechnology has been an issue for the last few years, and even though it is a great step for humanity, it also has its risks; but what are those risks? From the development of vaccines, to processes to recover ecosystems damaged by human activity, the uses and applications of biotechnology cover a wide spectrum of possibilities, as much as threats. 

This article will first of all focus on biotechnology in general, then introduce it as an existential risk, then introduce digital identities, and finally relate it to digital identities, and how it is a risk for them as well. 


## Biotechnology and its applications

Biotechnology is mostly the use of living organisms, as well as their parts or by-products, in industrial uses and applications. Biotechnology covers many areas, ranging from vaccines to developing new sources of biofuel, brewing beer, etc.

Biotechnology has multiple applications: environmental, bio sanitary, agricultural and livestock, and industrial. It is used to produce medicines, cloning, DNA analysis, industrial fermentation, vaccine production, genetic improvement, and even in forensics. Biotechnology is divided by colour: green, red, white, gold, grey, blue, yellow, violet, brown, and dark.

In this article we will focus mainly on gold, violet and black biotechnology. Gold biotechnology is in charge of bioinformatics, informatics, chip technology and biotechnology, this being a great help in technological advances as they are not simply areas in which it is developed, but rather, it is part of the future that awaits us. 

On the other hand, violet biotechnology focuses on the study of the legal aspects surrounding this science, as biotechnology is controversial and can be dangerous. That is why violet biotechnology exists, to control and regulate it, so that all the information that exists in the world remains safe. 

Black biotechnology is the opposite, it is in charge of producing biological warfare and also includes bioterrorism, where pathogenic, virulent and resistant micro-organisms are researched. It is the nest of biotechnological weapons.


## Advantages and Disadvantages of Biotechnology

**Advantages:** ☑️ 

- Can help improve health
* Flexibility in the food chain
+ Opportunities for medical breakthroughs
- Preserves resources
* Reduces the rate of disease


**Disadvantages:** ❎ 

- Economic instability
* Can be used as a biological weapon
+ Can be unethical
- Research field with many unknowns
* Turns human life into a commodity


## Existential risks and Digital Identities

But how does biotechnology relate to existential risks? Can it? Let me tell you yes, and I will show you. As mentioned above, existential risks are risks that threaten human existence, such as climate change, nuclear warfare, artificial intelligence, and in this case, biotechnology. Yes, but how? Well, have you ever heard of digital identities? These are the set of information that, together, project a reputation about each individual on the internet. To a large extent, it is made up of our digital footprint, and the data we constantly generate, whether consciously or unconsciously. Data such as: email address, date of birth, bank details, and e-commerce shopping habits. 

"In real life, our tastes, preferences, personality, behaviour, physical traits, etc. mark who we are. This personal profile is also created in the virtual world, and we know it as digital identity ” (Santander, 2022)

There are many advantages of all that digital identities entail, such as managing everything from your mobile phone, wallet, transportation, music, shopping, transfers, etc. But just as there are advantages, there are disadvantages, and they are a risk that has to be prevented, since all the information travels through many places, and sometimes we don't even notice it. There are many threats we are exposed to on a daily basis that put our identity at risk. To reduce these risks, we should take into account the following recommendations, which range from what is shared on social networks, to keeping our operating system always updated. 

1.	Protect our data and electronic devices:
2.	Be discreet about what you share on the internet, as well as reviewing the privacy settings on your accounts.
3.	Read carefully before clicking on unexpected messages.
4.	Create strong, secure passwords.
5.	Report suspected identity theft.


## How does Biotechnology threaten my digital identity?

Now yes, after a brief introduction to what each concept is, let's focus on biotechnology being a risk to digital identities. As mentioned above, one of the downsides of biotechnology is that it turns human life into a commodity, and how does this affect my digital identity, you may ask. Well, nowadays, our personal information is all over the place, including our fingerprints, since not many years ago, biometrics were implemented in mobile phones, which really made it easier for many things, but on the other hand, our fingerprint became part of the cloud. 

The problem is the misuse of what hackers can do, they have all the information they need in a single piece of data, because the fingerprint is not only used for the mobile phone, but it is also in the database of the countries, in credit cards, banks, etc. so there we have a problem. The cloning of many things stems from there, as we often don't realise what we are accepting, as we never take the time to read the terms and conditions of the websites we visit, we simply trust them, but we are often the ones who give permission to the websites to use our information as they please.

Of course, biotechnology has many good things, but it is important to be aware that it does affect us, and not only in the area of health and food mutations, but also our digital identity, it is necessary to be aware of what we accept on the internet, because not everything is safe and many things can be a farce. Yes, the problem is them for doing this kind of evil, but we are also to blame for being a bit careless and lazy to inform ourselves better.

On the other hand, bioterrorism is another crucial problem, you never know what will happen and what they are planning, many things can be altered and cause new diseases or viruses, and we have seen this before, we have lived it. So, when you think that biotechnology is the future and brings all good things, don't rule out that something bad can always happen and that people's intentions are not always good. Always take care of your data and keep it safe, before accessing any website make sure it is trustworthy.
